experimenting



i struggled with what to do on my very first attempt at applying my html knowledge. I wanted to use things that i had learned so far
so i asked my partner for some inspiration on what to make. she asked for a website that tracked the amount of money she would save should 
she choose to go out and forage in the wild for her own fruits and vegetables. 

website is not completed in its current state and i will look to add ids on html tags for css styling aswell as font changes, background 
colour, hover animations on links and flex wrap, i would also remove the contact us and place that on the footer once designed. she would like a login option with maps of your local area showing where wild foods grow
and what season they grow in. she would like me to develop an app which allows people to take a picture with their mobile phones and upload them
to maps then on the price chart be able to check for anything you can find in the wild, in the leading supermarkets showing everyone 
how much they have saved per kg of food they pick. She wanted an area where she could post news alerts and a contact us option. 

the logo image was made in a few minutes just to represent and image of some sort being in that location and to experiment myself.

reference list was used in places and that was https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp
